# osu!.db manager
story time:
one day i had the bright idea of moving ~130gb beatmaps to an old hard drive. no backups were created...
the unreliable hard drive unexpected broke, and all my beatmaps were lost. however, i still had my `osu!.db` file! thus, i must redeem myself by writing this project to read my `osu!.db` and redownload all my lost beatmaps.
